Project Overview

This project is based on writing a review research paper that explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL) techniques, has contributed to major advancements in cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning.

Cancer remains one of the most complex and life-threatening diseases worldwide. Traditional methods of diagnosis and treatment often require extensive clinical expertise and time-consuming procedures. With the rapid growth of Deep Learning, AI-based systems are now capable of analyzing large-scale medical data with improved accuracy, enabling faster and more personalized cancer care.
